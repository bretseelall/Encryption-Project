# Encryption-Project
This program was created by me and my group at our community college for our cybersecurity project where we had to create a basic encryption program to encrypt and decrypt a body of text. The program works by asking the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a body text. When the encryption option is chosen, it asks the user to enter two numbers. The first number is used to multiply the ASCII value of each character in the text and the second number adds to the ASCII value after the multiplication. Then the program will ask the user to input their text to be encrypted and then the program will return the encrypted text when done. The decryption process works by asking the user for the two numbers used for the encryption and the encrypted text, then the program basically reverses the process to get the original text back.
